## Description
We used modal, hopsworks and huggingface spaces to create a prediction app for the survival of titanic passengers. We also implemented batch inference to run on randomly generated data and a monitoring app for the predictions on this data.

The files for the titanic lab are found @ `lab1/second_part/`
