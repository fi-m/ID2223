# ID2223 Lab 1

## Description
We used modal, hopsworks and huggingface spaces to create a prediction app for the survival of titanic passengers. We also implemented batch inference to run on randomly generated data and a monitoring app for the predictions on this data.

The files for the titanic lab are found @ `lab1/second_part/` and in the hugginface spaces for the apps.

# ID2223 Lab 2

## Description
In Lab 2, we fine tuned the model __whisper-small__ for transcription of swedish using colab. We also improved our finetuned model using primarily a data centric approach, more information on the improvement is in the [README of the Lab 2 folder](https://github.com/fi-m/ID2223/blob/main/lab2/README.md). We also created a POC [Gradio application](https://huggingface.co/spaces/antonbol/finetune_whisper) on huggingface that uses the transcription model.
